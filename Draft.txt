The term – ‘Quantitative Easing’ (QE) caught everyone’s attentions shortly after the 2008 subprime crisis, when the Federal Reserve kicked off the massive open market operations at the end of November 2008. Three rounds of QEs injected totally $3.638 trillion additional currencies into the US economy within 5 years with the interest rate around on the floor at 0% to boost the economy.

Along with the gigantic money printing, is the static CPI rate. Throughout the course of the QE, monthly CPI floated within the 0.4% band, slightly lower than the annual targeted inflation at 2%.
