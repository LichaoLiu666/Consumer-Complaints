How would Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) impact the Liquidity

Introduction (1)
after financial crisis, supervisory stress test and CCAR were designed to strengthen both captial adequacy asssessment and BHCs' internal capital assessment processes from forward-looking perspective. These programs concentrated on BHCs' ability to absorb unexpected losses, while also experiencing revenue declines and to continue to function as credit intermediaries.

1. History (1)

1.1 19 largest BHCs participated in SCAP (the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program back in early 2009.
SCAP assessment requires BHCs to meet a post-stress tier 1 common equity ratio of 4 percent and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent.

note:see SCAP 2009 results here: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20090507a1.pdf

1.2 Based on SCAP, Fed initiated CCAR in late 2010In November 2011, the board of governors requiring all BHCs with total consoliated assets of $50 billion or more to participate in CCAR.
in 2013: 18 banks in CCAR
in 2014, there are 30 banks in CCAR.

Under CCAR, the post-stress capital ratios are calculated using the capital actions10 in the BHCs' capital plans while supervisory stress tests conducted under the Dodd-Frank Act use stylized assumptions required in the stress testing rules to calculate the post-stress capital ratios. DFA Stress incorprate a standardized captial action assumptions while CCAR incorporate BHCs' planned capital actions over9 quarters.

Achievements in 2013: Notably, the aggregate tier 1 common equity ratio of the 18 BHCs that have participated in CCAR through 2013 has more than doubled in the nearly five years since year-end 2008, from 5.6 percent to 11.3 percent, a net gain of about $400 billion of tier 1 common equity in absolute terms (see figure 1). In addition, CCAR is leading to improvements in risk measurement and capital planning practices across the firms.
